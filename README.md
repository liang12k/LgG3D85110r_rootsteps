Root steps for LG G3 D85110r and addtional steps/references taken to get root

Goal:
-----
to provide the steps and additional taken to get root onto T-Mobile's LG G3 D85110r


Purpose:
--------
even with the XDA guide below (near fail proof), I went through hoops to get the D85110r rooted.
^ most of it with adb commands, unplug-replug usb, revoke-reenable debug RSA permissions
ideally these set of references can help a user avoid such complications and just get the root done.


General guide:
--------------
follow this XDA guide by 'vcurbel':
